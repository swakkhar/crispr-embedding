> **Abstract:** In the realm of gene editing, CRISPR/Cas9 stands as a groundbreaking tool for biologists and researchers. However, it carries the risk of unintended edits, potentially disrupting normal cell functions. To enhance the accuracy of off-target prediction, many computational approaches have been employed. Yet, conventional techniques face challenges like data imbalance and complexity.In this paper, we have devised a deep learning model, namely CRISPR-Embedding, using a simple yet effective 9 layered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
for the prediction of CRISPR/Cas9 off-targets while implementing DNA k-mer embedding for sequence representation. In addition, using data augmentation and under-sampling we produced a substantially cleaner dataset to diffuse data imbalance issues. Evaluating
CRISPR-Embedding with 5-fold cross validation, an average accuracy of 94.07% has been realized. Furthermore, comparison with other state-of-the-art methods has clearly showed improved off-target activity prediction in case of CRISPR-Embedding.
